# OV7670-with-FPGA-and-Demosaicing
This project is intended to exercise concepts relating to embedded digital image processing with FPGAs. 
In particular, to become familiar with interfacing with the OV7670 using I2C, demosaicing bayer pattern, and with VGA output.
 was also to develop a concrete understanding of pipeling and parallelism.

## Suggested Reading (reading that I did)
The basic areas that need to be covered are
- I2C protocol
- VGA
- OV7670 datasheet (https://web.mit.edu/6.111/www/f2016/tools/OV7670_2006.pdf)
- DSPs
